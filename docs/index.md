# Introduction
## What is Zylang
Zylang is a series of programming languages for different scenarios.

## Why the language is named "Zylang"
The name of the language is inspired by Mr. Zhu, A Chinese actor. Since it is not authorized by himself or his studio, I will not put his full name here.

## How to get involved
Since the author is a native Chinese speaker, not good at other languages. If you feel like to help translate the documents from Chinese to another, or correct others' translation. Leave a message on our [github project](https://github.com/langlabs/zylang/issues/1).
